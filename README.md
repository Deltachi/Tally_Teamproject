 	<h4>
 		Develop an Electronic Coffee Tally.
 	</h4>
 	<p>
 		Do you have a kitchen at work/university? Do you have to draw a dash for every coffee you want to take? Why do you want to live in the stone age? Trash this old, messy check list, with all that unreadable stuff scribbled on it and get our new and awesome Tally C&S Electric Coffee Tally. It makes stuff so much easier, we promise.
